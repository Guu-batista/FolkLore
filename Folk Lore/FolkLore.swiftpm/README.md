# About Me #

Hello, my name is Gustavo José Batista and I'm 26 years old, living and born in Campinas, in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. I am currently in the first year of the Apple Developer Academy and in the second year of my degree in Systems Analysis and Development.

I haven't always been involved in the world of programming, but I've always been a technology enthusiast. Because of this, and also having many friends in the field, I decided to study more about it and learn how things work beyond just the user experience.

I am also very engaged in the culture of my country and the world. I am a fan of Brazilian folklore and its mystical creatures, as well as a fan of art and the cultural context they convey. That's why I decided to create an app that showcases a bit more about the culture of the country I live in.

In addition to culture, I am also a big fan of sports, video games, and Taylor Swift. 

I hope you have fun and enjoy the experience!
Thanks! :D
